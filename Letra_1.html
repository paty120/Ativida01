    <h1> The Beatles </h1>


    <h2> Across the Universe </h2>


    <h3> Words are flowing out
        Like endless rain into a paper cup
        They slither while they pass
        They slip away across the universe
        Pools of sorrow, waves of joy
        Are drifting through my opened mind
        Possessing and caressing me
        Jai guru deva, Om
        Nothing's gonna change my world
        Nothing's gonna change my world
        Nothing's gonna change my world
        Nothing's gonna change my world </h3>
